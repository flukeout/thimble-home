      <h1>Keep Calm Tutorial</h1>
      <p>
          Hello! You'll be making a couple of small changes to the Stay Calm poster. Follow the instructions below
          to learn how to do stuff like edit HTML and change colors!
      </p>

      <h4>History of the Keep Calm and Carry On Poster</h4>
      <p>
        The Keep Calm and Carry On poster was created in Britain in 1939 as a morale booster during WWII.
        It was thought the posters were destroyed until they were rediscovered almost 60 years later. They live on today as a meme.
      </p>

      <h4>Instructions</h4>

      <ol class="steps">

        <!-- Step 1-->
        <li>
            <h6>Change the words of the poster</h6>
            <p>
              Go to line 18 of index.html and change the text to something new that you've brainstormed.
              You will see your changes in the preview panel. HTML
            </p>
            <p>
              Tip: The &lt;br /&gt; tag represents a line break. Unlike most tags, &lt;br /&gt; tags do not need a corresponding “closing” tag.
            </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 2-->
        <li>
          <h6>Change the background color </h6>
          <p>Use the file tree on the left side of the screen to navigate to the file called "style.css"</p>
          <p>
            Go to line 2 to change the background-color property. First, just replace "darkred" with a different color, like "yellowgreen.
            Be sure not to have spaces between the words that describe your color.
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h6>Change the Thimble image</h6>
          <p>
            This project comes with two built-in image options - the crown and a thimble.
            You can see the thimble by clicking on "thimble.svg" in the file tree.
          <p>

          <ol>
            <li>Open the "index.html" file</li>
            <li>On line 14 you can see the where the crown image is inserted</li>
            <li>Delete "crown.svg" and type "thimble.svg"</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>
          <h6>Share your meme </h6>
          <p>
            When you're ready to share your meme, click the "Publish" button in the top righthand corner.
            Give your project a description and then click the green Publish button. You'll see a url for your project.
            Send the url to your family and friends, or post it on Facebook or Twitter using the hashtag #teachtheweb.
          </p>
        </li>

      </ol>
